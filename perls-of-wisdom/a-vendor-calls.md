# A vendor calls you

... and offers his/her process, tool or solution.

For simplicity here: let's call it **tool**

..., because unless you successfully implemented it and solved one or more actual requirements and/or problems you have, it is still only a tool, not a solution.

We don't do '_ah here is a tool, let's find a problem for it_'. Honestly, if there is **no tangible requirement** or problem: don't waste your energy and the energy of the provider with random or fictivious PoCs - proof-of-concepts.

Also reflect, whether the '_suggested problem_'  can already be solved with your portfolio at hand by spending some more energy and brains.

**Say no** ... in a friendly but determined tone.
