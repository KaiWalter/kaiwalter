# A vendor calls you

... and offers his/her process, tool or solution.

For simplicity here: let's call it **tool**

..., because unless you successfully implemented it and solved one or more actual requirements and/or problems you have, it is still only a tool, not a solution.

We don't do '_ah here is a tool, let's find a problem for it_'. Honestly, if there is **no tangible requirement** or problem: don't waste your energy and the energy of the provider with random or fictivious PoCs - proof-of-concepts.

I guess you also do not have endless bandwidth to squeeze in PoCs all the time.

Also reflect, whether the '_suggested problem_'  can already be solved with your portfolio at hand by spending some more energy and brains.

**Say no** ... in a friendly but determined tone.

**However** it is valid to listen to vendors knocking at the door - to look outside your bubble or solution space. That does not hurt. You need to do that to know '_what's going on_' and what trends or opportunities come up in the market. I am just saying: be careful with committments.
